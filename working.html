        <h3>09/2015-present: Accenture Fellow @ <a style=" color: blue;"href="https://www.accenture.com/">Accenture</a> and Duke University</h3>        
        <p><font size="4">Our proposal "Flexible and Scalable Probabilistic Models 
            for Healthcare Data" is one of the four selected proposals for Accenture-Duke
            Analytics Research Program. We received $50,000 research grant from Accenture,
            which will cover my tuition and living expenses at Duke for 12 months. 
            The project endeavors to develop a flexible and computationally scalable framework
            for medical service recommendations and personalized medicine, by analyzing heterogeneous
            and unstructured electronic health records (EHR) data. </font>

        <h3>05/2015-08/2015: Research Intern @ <a style=" color: blue;"href="https://labs.oracle.com/pls/apex/f?p=LABS:10::::::">Oracle Labs</a> (previous Sun Labs), Burlington, MA</h3>        
        <p><font size="4">Proposed a Bayesian bilinear factor method for context-based topic learning. 
        The method models (1) the correlation between topics, and (2) evolution of word-word 
        co-occurrence pattern as the distance between the current word and the word in the
        context grows. For the inference, batch Gibbs sampling as well as online Gibbs sampling
        were implemented. In addition, I further developed a parallel implementation for online learning.
        All inference methods were implemented using Java. We applied our model on large-scale Wikipedia 
        dataset, and reasonable results were obtained with respect to computational acceleration 
        (due to parallel computing), word embedding, topic and topic correlation learning.</font>

         <p><font size="4">Worked on talent search project for <a style=" color: blue;"href="https://www.behance.net/">Behance</a>, which is a social media
            platform acquired by Adobe to enhance its creative cloud community. 
            The project aimed to recommend talented creatives and high-quality
            projects to users and company recruiters.The recommendation system was 
            accomplished by using a hierarchical regression model, which scaled to 
            large appreciation data containing about 2 million users, 8 million projects, 
            and 400 million appreciation records. The model was implemented using Python, 
            and run on Amazon EC2.</font>
